# NEWS for pdp package

### Changes for version 0.5.3
* Properly registered native routines and disabled symbol search.
* Fixed bug for `gbm` objects with the multinomial distribution.
* Refactored code to improve structure.
* `partial` gained three new options: `inv.link` (experimental), `ice`, and `center`. The latter two have to do with constructing individual conditional expectation (ICE) curves and cetered ICE (c-ICE) curves. The `inv.link` option is for transforming predictions from models that can use non-Gaussian distibutions (e.g., `glm`, `gbm`, and `xgboost`). Note that these options were added for convenience and the same results (plus much more) can still be obtained using the flexible `pred.fun` argument. [(#36)](https://github.com/bgreenwell/pdp/issues/36).
* `plotPartial` gained five new options: `center`, `plot.pdp`, `pdp.col`, `pdp.lwd`, and `pdp.lty`; see `?plotPartial` for details.
* Fixed default y-axis label for `autoplot` with two numeric predictors [(#48)](https://github.com/bgreenwell/pdp/issues/48).
* Added `CITATION` file.
* Added AppVeyor support for continuous building/testing on a Microsoft Windows virtual machine.
* Better support for neuaral networks from the `nnet` package.

### Changes for version 0.5.2
* Fixed minor pandoc conversion issue with `README.md`.
* Added subdirectory called `tools` to hold figures for `README.md`.

### Changes for version 0.5.1
* Registered native routines and disabled symbol search.

### Changes for version 0.5.0
* Added support for `MASS::lda`, `MASS::qda`, and `mda::mars`.
* New arguments `quantiles`, `probs`, and `trim.outliers` in `partial`. These arguments make it easier to construct PDPs over the relevant range of a numeric predictor without having to specify `pred.grid`, especially when outliers are present in the predictors (which can distort the plotted relationship).
* The `train` argument can now accept matrices; in particular, object of class `"matrix"` or `"dgCMatrix"`. This is useful, for example, when working with XGBoost models (i.e., objects of class `"xgb.Booster"`).
* New logical argument `prob` indicating whether or not partial dependence values for classification problems should be returned on the original probability scale, rather than the centered logit; details for the centered logit can be found on page 370 in the second edition of [*The Elements of Statistical Learning*](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).
* Fixed some typos in `NEWS.md`.
* New function `autoplot` for automatically creating `ggplot2` graphics from `"partial"` objects.

### Changes for version 0.4.0
* `partial` is now much faster with `"gbm"` object due to a call to `gbm::plot.gbm` whenever `pred.grid` is not explicitly given by the user. (`gbm::plot.gbm` exploits a computational shortcut that does not involve any passes over the training data.)
* New (experimental) function `topPredictors` for extracting the names of the most "important" predictors. This should make it one step easier (in most cases) to construct PDPs for the most "important"" features in a fitted model.
* A new argument, `pred.fun`, allows the user to supply their own prediction function. Hence, it is possible to obtain PDPs based on the median, rather than the mean. It is also possible to obtain PDPs for classification problems on the probability scale. See `?partial` for examples.
* Minor bug fixes and documentation tweaks.

### Changes for version 0.3.0
* The `...` argument in the call to `partial` now refers to additional arguments to be passed onto `stats::predict` rather than `plyr::aaply`. For example, using `partial` with `"gbm"` objects will require specification of `n.trees` which can now simply be passed to `partial` via the `...` argument.
* Added the following arguments to `partial`: `progress` (`plyr`-based progress bars), `parallel` (`plyr`/`foreach`-based parallel execution), and `paropts` (list of additional arguments passed onto `foreach` when `parallel = TRUE`).
* Various bug fixes.
* `partial` now throws an informative error message when the `pred.grid` argument refers to predictors not in the original training data.
* The column name for the predicted value has been changed from `"y"` to `"yhat"`.

### Changes for version 0.2.0
* `randomForest` is no longer imported.
* Added support for the `caret` package (i.e., objects of class `"train"`).
* Added example data sets: `boston` (corrected Boston housing data) and `pima` (corrected Pima Indians diabetes data).
* Fixed error that sometimes occurred when `chull = TRUE` causing the convex hull to not be computed.
* Refactored `plotPartial` to be more modular.
* Added `gbm` support for most non-`"binomial"` families`.

### Changes for version 0.1.0
* `randomForest` is now imported.
* Added examples.

### Changes for version 0.0.6
* Fixed a non canonical CRAN URL in the README file.

### Changes for version 0.0.5
* `partial` now makes sure each column of `pred.grid` has the correct class, levels, etc.
* `partial` gained a new option, `levelplot`, which defaults to `TRUE`. The original option, `contour`, has changed and now specifies whether or not to add contour lines whenever `levelplot = TRUE`.

### Changes for version 0.0.4
* Fixed a number of URLs.
* More thorough documentation.

### Changes for version 0.0.2

* Fixed a couple of URLs and typos.
* Added more thorough documentation.
* Added support for C5.0, Cubist, nonlinear least squares, and XGBoost models.

### Changes for version 0.0.1

* Initial release.
